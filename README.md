Spring Boot + Ionic üçª

This project is an example application for a typical [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) app with a [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) backend.

You can read about how this application was created in this tutorial. Feel free to copy any code in this project for your own use in accordance with the Apache license.

Prerequisites: `Java 8` and `Node.js`.

To run the Spring Boot backend, cd into `server` and run `mvn spring-boot:run`.

In another terminal window, install Ionic and Cordova.

`npm install -g ionic cordova`

Next, cd into client and execute `npm install && ionic serve`. The aforementioned tutorial shows you how to deploy this app to an emulator/device.

To see how your application will look on different devices you can run `ionic serve --lab`. The --lab flag opens a page in your browser that lets you see how your app looks on different devices.
