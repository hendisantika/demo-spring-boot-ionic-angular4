Spring Boot API

Create your Spring Boot API project using start.spring.io or the command line.

http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
dependencies==data-jpa,data-rest,h2,web,devtools -d

    Open project in IntelliJ IDEA. Create a Beer entity class in src/main/java/com/example/beer. → boot-entity
    Create a JPA Repository to manage the Beer entity (tip: @RepositoryRestResource). → boot-repository
    Create a CommandLineRunner to populate the database. → boot-command
    Add default data in the run() method. → boot-add
    Create a BeerController for your REST API. Add some business logic that results in a /good-beers endpoint. → boot-controller
    Add a /good-beers mapping that filters out beers that aren't great. → boot-good

Git Commit
Create Ionic App

Install Ionic and Cordova:

yarn global add cordova ionic

From a terminal window, create a new application using the following command:

ionic start ionic-beer --v2
cd ionic-beer
ionic serve

Git Commit
Build a Good Beers UI

    Run ionic generate page beer.
    Add BeerPageModule to the imports list in app.module.ts.
    Create src/providers/beer-service.ts. → io-beer-service
    Modify beer.html to show the list of beers. → io-beer-list
    Update beer.ts to import BeerService and add as a provider. Call the getGoodBeers() method in the ionViewDidLoad() lifecycle method. → io-get-good-beers
    To expose this page on the tab bar, add it to tabs.ts. Update tabs.html too!

If you run ionic serve, you’ll likely see a CORS error in your browser’s console. To fix this, open your BeerController and add the following line to the good beers endpoint.

@CrossOrigin(origins = {"http://localhost:8100","file://"})

Restart Spring Boot and your Ionic app.

Add some fun with Giphy! Create giphy-service.ts. → ng-giphy-service

Update beer.ts to take advantage of GiphyService. → ng-giphy-foreach

Update beer.html to display the image retrieved. → io-avatar

If everything works as expected, you should see a page with a list of beers and images.
Add a Modal for Editing

Change the header in beer.html to have a button that opens a modal to add a new beer. → io-open-modal

In this same file, change <ion-item> to have a click handler for opening the modal for the current item.

<ion-item (click)="openModal({id: beer.id})">

Add ModalController as a dependency in BeerPage and add an openModal() method. → io-open-modal-ts

This won't compile because BeerModalPage doesn't exist. Create beer-modal.ts in the same directory. → io-beer-modal

Create beer-modal.html as a template for this page. → io-beer-modal-html

Import BeerModalPage in beer.ts and add it to the declarations and entryComponent lists in beer.module.ts.

You'll also need to modify beer-service.ts to have get() and save() methods. → io-get-save

Demo how editing fails, then add CrossOrigin annotation to BeerRepository.

@CrossOrigin(origins = {"http://localhost:8100","file://"})

Add Swipe to Delete

To add swipe-to-delete functionality on the list of beers, open beer.html and make it so <ion-item-sliding> wraps <ion-item> and contains the *ngFor. → io-swipe

Add a remove() method to beer.ts. → io-remove

Add toastCtrl: ToastController as a dependency in the constructor so everything compiles.

After making these additions, you should be able to add, edit and delete beers.
PWAs with Ionic

Run the Lighthouse Chrome extension on this application. To register a service worker, and improve the app’s score, uncomment the serviceWorker block in index.html.

After making this change, the score should improve. In my tests, it increased to 75/100.

If you refresh the app and Chrome doesn’t prompt you to install the app (a PWA feature), you probably need to turn on a couple of features.

chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks
chrome://flags/#enable-add-to-shelf

After enabling these flags, you’ll see an error in your browser’s console about assets/imgs/logo.png not being found. This files is referenced in src/manifest.json. You can fix this by copying a 512x512 PNG into this location or by modifying manifest.json accordingly.
Deploy to a Mobile Device

To see how your application will look on different devices you can run ionic serve --lab. The --lab flag opens opens a page in your browser that lets you see how your app looks on different devices.
iOS

To emulate or deploy to an iOS device, you’ll need a Mac and a fresh installation of Xcode. If you’d like to build iOS apps on Windows, Ionic offers an Ionic Package service.

ionic cordova emulate ios

The biggest problem I found when running the app in Simulator was that it was difficult to get the keyboard to popup. To workaround this, I used Edit > Hardware > Keyboard > Toggle Software Keyboard when I needed to type text in a field.

To deploy the app to an iPhone, start by plugging your iOS device into your computer. Then run the following commands to install ios-deploy/ios-sim, build the app, and run it on your device.

npm install -g ios-deploy ios-sim
ionic build ios --prod
open platforms/ios/MyApp.xcodeproj

Select your phone as the target in Xcode and click the play button to run your app.
Android

To deploy to the Android emulator, run ionic cordova emulate android.
